# Understanding Automatic Text Summarization

## Introduction

Text summarization is the process of shortening a long piece of text with the goal of keeping its meaning and effect as intact as possible. There are mainly four types of summaries:

1. Single Document Summary: Summary of a Single Document
2. Multi-Document Summary: Summary from multiple documents
3. Query Focused Summary: Summary of a specific query
4. Informative Summary: It includes a summary of the full information
